# Dell-Inspiron-7573-OpenCore-Hackintosh

I have yet to see an "Easy and Clean" Guide since my hacking this laptop(10.13.6 - 10.14.6), (Clover). Loved Clover since it taught me so much, but very difficult to maintain for the average "non" Hackintosh inclined mind. So With the enhancements of the OC Bootloader and the Desire to have a 100% working Hackintosh Laptop, I decided to take the jump to OpenCore. I must say, I'm so Pleased with the Results. I won't do a step by step. Ill make a video for that. Instead, what I've done is made this complete and ready for Install. If possible, Id like users with this laptop (or similar) to use this OC zip as baseline for simple complete configuration and to give FEEDBACK please. Just download the OC.zip,(Change MLB, SUUID, Serial and ROM) Place Onto your installer, mount EFI partition (After Installation) and transfer to your SSD or HD. Enjoy!
